"""Long-form documentation for the in-app help panel.

Two dictionaries:

* `FEATURE_DOCS` — entries for the app itself (menu items, panels, concepts).
* `OP_DOCS` — entries for every registered operation.

Each entry is HTML (Qt's QTextBrowser subset — `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`,
`<li>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<code>`). Content is intentionally beginner-friendly:
what the thing does, when to reach for it, and which other features it
composes well with. Keep entries focused — the on-screen panel is for

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>cvsandbox is an interactive playground for OpenCV pipelines. The typical
workflow is:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>1. Load something to look at.</b> Use <code>File &rarr; Open
      Image</code>, <code>Open Camera</code>, or <code>Open Video</code> —
      or the matching buttons in the action bar below the image.</li>
  <li><b>2. Add operations.</b> Click an op in the left catalog. It joins
      the bottom node-graph strip, automatically wired to the previous step.</li>
  <li><b>3. Tune the parameters.</b> Click a node and edit its sliders /
      dropdowns in the right panel. The image and histogram update live.</li>
  <li><b>4. Save the result.</b> The teal <b>Save Image</b> button below the
      image writes the full-resolution output to disk. For live capture,
      <b>Record Video</b> streams each processed frame to an mp4 / avi.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two further power features live alongside: <b>Export Code</b> emits a
self-contained Python function reproducing the pipeline, and <b>Batch
Process Folder</b> applies it to every image in a folder.</p>

        body="""
<h2>Opening files</h2>
<h3>Open Image</h3>
<p>Loads a single image file. Supported formats include PNG, JPG, BMP,
TIFF, and WebP — anything OpenCV's <code>imread</code> understands.</p>
<p><b>16-bit and floating-point TIFFs</b> are handled specially: their
dynamic range is rescaled to uint8 instead of clipped, so high-bit-depth
microscopy / scanner / HDR exports display correctly instead of saturating
to white.</p>
<h3>Open Camera</h3>
<p>Starts streaming from the default webcam (device index 0). Each frame
flows through the live pipeline; histograms and timing update in real time.
Use <b>Stop Capture</b> to release the device.</p>
<h3>Open Video</h3>
<p>Plays back a video file (mp4, mov, avi, mkv, webm). The frame rate is
gated by the heaviest step in the pipeline — if the pipeline takes 80 ms,
the display tops out near 12 fps regardless of the source's native rate.
This keeps the worker thread from queueing endless backlog.</p>

    FeatureTopic(
        key="pipeline_editor",
        title="The pipeline / node graph",
        body="""
<h2>Pipeline editor</h2>
<p>The strip at the bottom of the window is your pipeline rendered as a
node graph. Under the hood it is a true DAG (directed acyclic graph), so
each op can in principle take inputs from multiple upstream nodes and feed
multiple downstream consumers. For most workflows the chain you build by
clicking operations is enough.</p>
<h3>Anatomy of a node</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Title</b> — the op name. The coloured strip on the left encodes
      its category.</li>
  <li><b>Ports</b> — circles on the left (inputs) and right (output). The
      first node automatically wires from the Source; multi-input ops have
      one circle per port, stacked vertically.</li>
  <li><b>Green / grey chip</b> (top-right region) toggles the node on or
      off; a disabled node passes its input through untouched.</li>
  <li><b>X chip</b> removes the node from the pipeline.</li>
  <li><b>Timing badge</b> beneath the title shows how long the last preview
      run spent on that step.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wiring extra connections</h3>
<p>Drag from an output port onto another node's input port to add an edge —
useful for feeding a Blend / Apply Mask / Difference op's second input.
Drag from a connected input port to detach or re-route. The system rejects
edges that would form cycles, duplicate connections, or use unknown ports.</p>
<h3>Repositioning</h3>
<p>Drag a node body to move it anywhere on the canvas. The position
persists through refreshes and round-trips through <b>Save Pipeline</b>.
The Source node is also free to move.</p>

<h2>Image view</h2>
<p>The big central panel where the pipeline output is rendered.</p>
<h3>Zoom and pan</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Mouse wheel</b> zooms in / out at the cursor location.</li>
  <li><b>Left-drag</b> pans.</li>
  <li><b>Double-click</b> resets to fit-in-view.</li>
</ul>
<p>The view remembers your zoom across parameter changes as long as the
output shape stays the same — only operations that change image dimensions
(e.g. Resize) reset the fit.</p>
<h3>Before / After split (Ctrl+B)</h3>
<p>Toggle a side-by-side comparison: the original image on the left, the
pipeline output on the right. Heights are normalised; mixed grayscale and
BGR pairs are unified into BGR for a sensible display. Tools that overlay
on a single image (ROI rectangle, paste-destination rectangle) are hidden
in split mode because the composite has different coordinates.</p>
""",
    ),
    FeatureTopic(
        key="histogram",
        title="Histogram panel",
        body="""
<h2>Histogram panel</h2>
<p>The small graph at the bottom-right shows the <b>distribution of pixel
intensities</b> in the current pipeline output. X axis is 0-255; Y axis is
how many pixels hit each value (normalised so the tallest bar reaches the
top).</p>
<h3>How to read it</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Pile on the left</b> &rarr; image is dark; shadow detail likely
      hidden.</li>
  <li><b>Pile on the right</b> &rarr; image is bright; highlights may be
      clipped (lost detail).</li>
  <li><b>Narrow central spike</b> &rarr; low contrast (fog / haze).</li>
  <li><b>Wide, even spread</b> &rarr; rich tonal range.</li>
  <li><b>Two sharp bars at 0 and 255 only</b> &rarr; healthy binary output
      (Canny, Otsu, In-Range Mask).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Channel overlays</h3>
<p>Single-channel inputs show one grey curve. BGR inputs draw three
translucent curves (blue, green, red) over the same axis so you can spot
colour imbalances — a sun-tinted photo would show the red peak far to the
right of the blue peak.</p>
<h3>Practical use</h3>
<p>Pick threshold values by looking for valleys in the histogram between
two peaks. When tuning CLAHE, watch the histogram broaden as contrast
amplifies. After Canny, confirm the output really is binary (two spikes,
nothing in between) — anything else means the chain isn't producing a clean
edge map.</p>

      processed ROI crop onto a random spot inside the image.</li>

      the ROI's own position (default).</li>
</ul>
""",
    ),
    FeatureTopic(
        key="roi",
        title="Region of interest (ROI)",
        body="""
<h2>Region of interest</h2>
<p>Run the pipeline only inside a user-drawn rectangle, leaving the rest of
the image untouched. Useful for tuning a chain against one area before
deciding to apply it globally, or for compositing transformations into a
specific patch.</p>
<h3>Drawing</h3>
<p>Activate <b>Select ROI</b> (Ctrl+R) — the cursor becomes a cross. Click
and drag on the image to rubber-band a rectangle; release to commit. A
green dashed outline marks the region. The pipeline immediately switches
to ROI-only mode and updates the preview.</p>
<h3>Cut and paste somewhere else</h3>
<p>Once an ROI is drawn, dragging inside the green rectangle does
<i>not</i> move the source — it sets the <b>paste destination</b>. A cyan
dotted rectangle follows your cursor; releasing it drops the processed
crop at that spot. The original ROI area stays as-is, so you can stamp
the result wherever you like (or run the menu's "Randomize paste
destination" for a quick random placement).</p>
<h3>Channel and shape mismatches</h3>
<p>If the pipeline produces grayscale output while the source is BGR (or
vice-versa), the channel layout is automatically coerced so the splice
succeeds. Pipelines that change image dimensions (e.g. Resize) skip the
splice and leave the source untouched — the preview shows the original
image so it's obvious the ROI couldn't be applied.</p>

<h2>Downscaling preview mode</h2>
<p>Live preview redraws on every parameter change. For high-resolution
inputs (4K photographs, drone footage) that becomes painful — a single
Bilateral pass on a 4032 x 3024 image can take seconds.</p>
<p>The View sidebar's <b>Downscale large previews</b> toggle (on by
default) resizes any source whose longest side exceeds <b>1600 pixels</b>
down to 1600 with INTER_AREA before running the pipeline. The original
full-resolution image is preserved internally and used by:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Save Processed Image</b> — output is full-res, regardless of the
      preview setting.</li>
  <li><b>Batch Process Folder</b> — processes whatever the input files are
      natively.</li>
  <li><b>Export Code</b> — generates a function that works on any size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disable the toggle when you need to inspect very fine detail in the
preview. Re-enable it when the pipeline gets sluggish.</p>

<h2>Per-operation timing</h2>
<p>Each node in the bottom strip shows how long the last preview run spent
on that step (e.g. <code>12.4 ms</code>). Disabled or never-executed nodes
show no timing.</p>
<p>Use this to spot bottlenecks: if a Gaussian Blur is taking 200 ms while
everything else is under 10 ms, you have a candidate for a smaller kernel
or for moving it after a downscaling step. The timing is measured by the
preview worker thread, so the numbers include only the op's own work — not
Qt repaints or histogram updates.</p>

<p>Runs the pipeline on the <b>full-resolution</b> source and writes the
result to disk. The output format follows the chosen extension — PNG keeps
exact pixel values, JPG compresses, TIFF preserves precision (though
cvsandbox writes 8-bit content), BMP / WebP are also supported.</p>
<p>This is the right button when you want to commit the version you've
just tuned. It always uses the original loaded image, so even with
<b>Downscale large previews</b> active you still get a full-res output.</p>
<p>ROI, paste destinations, and multi-input wires are all respected —
whatever you see in the preview is what gets saved (just at native

correctly. The output is verified to match the live pipeline byte-for-byte
in the test suite — what you see is what you get when you copy the code
into your own project.</p>
<p>If the pipeline includes a ROI or composite ops, the generated code
also embeds a <code>_coerce_to_match</code> helper so channel-changing
steps splice back into the source cleanly.</p>

[low, high] interval. Pixels that match every channel become 255; the rest
become 0. The op normalises low/high if you accidentally swap them.</p>
<h3>Where it shines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Quick colour pickers when you already know the BGR bounds.</li>
  <li>Cleaning up rendered/synthetic images where target colours are exact.</li>
</ul>
<p>For chromatic targeting on natural images, prefer the
<b>HSV In-Range Mask</b> from the Color category — it's hue-based and far
less sensitive to lighting.</p>

<h2>Distance Transform</h2>
<p><i>segmentation.distance_transform · category: Segmentation</i></p>
<p>For each foreground pixel, computes the distance to the nearest
background pixel and normalises the result to 0-255. Enable <b>Color map</b>
to render with the jet palette — peaks (centres of large blobs) glow red,
edges fade to blue.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Distance type</b> — L2 (true Euclidean), L1 (city-block), or
      Chessboard. L2 is the most natural for geometric measurements.</li>
  <li><b>Mask size</b> — 3 is fast, 5 is more accurate, <i>Precise</i> uses
      a full Euclidean computation (slowest).</li>
  <li><b>Color map</b> — jet palette on/off.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where it shines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Building marker images for <b>Watershed</b>.</li>

<p>Labels each connected white blob in the (auto-binarised) input with a

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Connectivity</b> — 4-way only counts axial neighbours; 8-way also
      counts diagonals.</li>
  <li><b>Min area</b> — discard labels smaller than this many pixels.</li>

<h2>Watershed</h2>
<p><i>segmentation.watershed · category: Segmentation</i></p>
<p>Marker-based segmentation. The op runs the full classic recipe for you:
Otsu threshold → morphological opening → distance transform → connected
components → watershed. Final output: the original image (converted to BGR)
with watershed boundaries drawn in red.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Foreground threshold</b> — fraction of the peak distance value
      treated as <i>sure</i> foreground. Lower picks more area as foreground.</li>
  <li><b>Background dilation</b> — iterations of the dilate that builds
      <i>sure</i> background. Higher = wider unknown band.</li>
  <li><b>Noise kernel</b> — opening kernel size used to clean up specks
      before computing the distance transform.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where it shines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Separating touching objects (cells, coins, fruit) that a plain
      threshold merges into one blob.</li>

<h2>GrabCut (rect)</h2>

<p>Iterative foreground extraction. Initialises with a centred rectangle —

estimation and graph-cut optimisation. The output keeps foreground pixels
and blacks out everything else.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Rect margin (%)</b> — fraction of width/height treated as
      background border at init. 10-20% suits most centred subjects.</li>
  <li><b>Iterations</b> — refinement passes. More is slower; gains beyond
      5 are usually marginal.</li>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
