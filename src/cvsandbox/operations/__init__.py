"""Built-in OpenCV operations.

Each submodule exposes an `ALL: tuple[OperationSpec, ...]` of the specs it
provides. `load_builtin_operations()` registers every built-in spec; it is
idempotent so it can safely be called multiple times (e.g. from tests).

We deliberately avoid registration as an import-time side effect: it makes
registration order implicit and makes the registry hard to reset in tests.
