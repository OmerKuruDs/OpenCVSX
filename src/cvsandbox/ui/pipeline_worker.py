"""Background pipeline execution.

The UI thread builds a `PipelineRequest` — an immutable snapshot of (function,
params) pairs plus the source image — and emits it. A `PipelineWorker` running
on its own QThread receives the request, executes the steps, and emits the
result. The `request_id` lets the UI thread drop stale results when the user
has already moved on to another parameter change.

Snapshotting at request time means the worker never touches the live Pipeline,
so user edits on the UI thread are race-free.

Each step is timed via `perf_counter`; the per-step seconds are emitted
alongside the result image so the UI can render a per-operation timing HUD.
